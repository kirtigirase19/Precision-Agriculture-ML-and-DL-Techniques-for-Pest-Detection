# 🌱🐛 Precision-Agriculture-ML-and-DL-Techniques-for-Pest-Detection-and-Classification 

It is web application . It is capable working for Detection and Classification Pest from Trained dataset and Suggest the causes and prevention to prevent pest on crops. which is very helpful for farmer .
This project is a deep learning-based pest classification system built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model in Keras.
It helps detect and classify agricultural pests from images, with a Tkinter-based GUI for user interaction.

If the model encounters an unknown or untrained pest image, it reports the result as "Unknown" (based on a confidence threshold).

🌟 Features

✅ Pest classification using a trained CNN (pest.h5)

✅ Tkinter-based graphical user interface (GUI)

✅ Confidence thresholding to reject unknown images

✅ Simple image upload and display with bounding box annotation

✅ Detects common agricultural pests like:

◆ Aphids

◆ Armyworm

◆ Beetle

◆ Bollworm

◆ Grasshopper

◆ Mites

◆ Mosquito

◆ Sawfly

◆ Stem Borer


✅ Tkinter-based GUI with buttons for:

→ Image upload

→ Model testing

→ Grayscale conversion

→ Object detection with bounding boxes

✅ Displays causes and prevention suggestions for each detected pest.

✅ Rejects random/unrelated images as Unknown when confidence is low.
